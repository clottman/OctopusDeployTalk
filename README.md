# [Octopus Deploy: Automating .NET Development](https://www.slideshare.net/CasseyLottman/octopus-deploy-automating-net-deployments)
Presented at Nebraska.Code(), 5/18/2017

Octopus Deploy is a tool for .NET deployment automation. You can use it to deploy IIS websites, Windows services, and even certificates and scripts that you need to run on remote machines.

Octopus Deploy has the potential to make deploying from the build server to remote machines painless and repeatable- but there are some things you may want to know up front to make that happen. This session will explore why you might want to try Octopus Deploy, what sort of issues you may run into, and how Ocuvera uses Octopus to manage our on-premise product installations & updates.
